The NuoDB Storefront Demo 

This web application implements a mock storefront to highlight some of NuoDB's great features. You can browse products, add items to you cart, write reviews, and checkout. You can also simulate thousands of concurrent (simulated) shoppers with customizable workload characteristics.
